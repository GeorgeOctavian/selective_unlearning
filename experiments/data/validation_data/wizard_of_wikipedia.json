Plus you have to be so careful about who your child care provider will be. It's not cheap either.","In north carolina you have to be licensed by the state to watch two or more kids unrelated to you for more then 4 hours a day.","That makes sense. I'm sure all other states are regulated in the same way.","Yep! North carolina is the 9th most populous state in america. beautiful place to be with kids!","I love North Carolina.

Depression perhaps?","I don't think the cause is fully understood.  It could be genetic, could be biological, or it could be psychological.","Well, I guess the medical profession had better get to the bottom of it. It must be destroying people's lives!","I'm sure it is, but people are starting to see that behavioral therapy and a slow increase in activity can help counteract the effects.","That makes sense. If a person exercises it often brings ones energy levels up.","That seems to be the case.  It also looks like evidence has shown that there's no adverse effects from trying to counteract the effects of CFS, which is good.","That is good. A healthy diet, positive thinking and exercise are things we all need. Perhaps that's what's needed.","Hopefully.

Did they start out as a car company, or as something else?","I am not 100% sure on that however, I do know that it was founded by Enzo Ferrari and the company built its first car in 1940.
